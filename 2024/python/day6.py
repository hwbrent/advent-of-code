--- Day 6: Guard Gallivant ---

The Historians use their fancy device again, this time to whisk you all away to the North Pole prototype suit manufacturing lab... in the year 1518! It turns out that having direct access to history is very convenient for a group of historians.
You still have to be careful of time paradoxes, and so it will be important to avoid anyone from 1518 while The Historians search for the Chief. Unfortunately, a single guard is patrolling this part of the lab.
Maybe you can work out where the guard will go ahead of time so that The Historians can search safely?
You start by making a map (your puzzle input) of the situation. For example:
....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#..^.....
........#.
#.........
......#...

The map shows the current position of the guard with ^ (to indicate the guard is currently facing up from the perspective of the map). Any obstructions - crates, desks, alchemical reactors, etc. - are shown as #.
Lab guards in 1518 follow a very strict patrol protocol which involves repeatedly following these steps:

If there is something directly in front of you, turn right 90 degrees.
Otherwise, take a step forward.

Following the above protocol, the guard moves up several times until she reaches an obstacle (in this case, a pile of failed suit prototypes):
....#.....
....^....#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#........
........#.
#.........
......#...

Because there is now an obstacle in front of the guard, she turns right before continuing straight in her new facing direction:
....#.....
........>#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#........
........#.
#.........
......#...

Reaching another obstacle (a spool of several very long polymers), she turns right again and continues downward:
....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#......v.
........#.
#.........
......#...

This process continues for a while, but the guard eventually leaves the mapped area (after walking past a tank of universal solvent):
....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#........
........#.
#.........
......#v..

By predicting the guard's route, you can determine which specific positions in the lab will be in the patrol path. Including the guard's starting position, the positions visited by the guard before leaving the area are marked with an X:
....#.....
....XXXXX#
....X...X.
..#.X...X.
..XXXXX#X.
..X.X.X.X.
.#XXXXXXX.
.XXXXXXX#.
#XXXXXXX..
......#X..

In this example, the guard will visit 41 distinct positions on your map.
Predict the path of the guard. How many distinct positions will the guard visit before leaving the mapped area?

    This is how a loop has to look:

     x
            x
    x
           x

    Corners of the rectangle:
    - Top left:
      - 1 above the top right
      - 1 to the right of the bottom left
    - Top right:
      - 1 below the top left
      - 1 to the right of the bottom right
    - Bottom left:
      - 1 above the bottom right
      - 1 to the left of the top left
    - Bottom right:
      - 1 below the bottom left
      - 1 to left of top right

    So each "corner" is 1 above/below another, and 1 left/right of another

    Each obstacle could be any of the four types of corner.

    Potential algorithm to get loops:
    - For each obstacle in the grid:
        - For each type of corner:
            - Find where the other two adjacent corners would be
              (i.e. if this corner is bottom right, we find the bottom left
              and top right)
            - If we can't find those, continue
            - If we can, use the distances between the three corners to
              figure out where the fourth corner should be
            - In theory, there shouldn't be a corner there already. Record
              that location as a place for a loop

    Then we have to confirm if the potential loops are loops that the guard
    could actually end up in. Algorithm:

    - For loop in loops:
        - For corner in loop:
            - Check if the coordinate is actually within the bounds of the
              input. If not, obviously this loop isn't valid
            - Check if the guard ever visited the correct side
              (e.g. if we're talking about the bottom left corner, the guard
              would have to have visited the square to the right of it,
              because she would then turn 90Ëš and go up and hit the top
              left)
            - If yes, this loop is valid. Else, it's not
